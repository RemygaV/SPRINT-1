                <img class="topics-images" src="IMG/Python-1.jpg" alt="foto">
                <p> Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and
                    data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many
                    non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing
                    finances.

                <img class="topics-images" src="IMG/python-2.jpg" alt="foto">
                <p> Java. Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take
                    much less time to develop. ... Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder
                    than Java's.

                <p class="titles-of-topics">Why is Python so popular?</p>
                <img class="topics-images" src="IMG/Python-3.jpg" alt="foto">
                <p> The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has
                    simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its
                    ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other
                    programming languages.
